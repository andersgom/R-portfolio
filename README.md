## R portfolio

This repository holds all the code from my personal R projects.

- Data cleaning: I used the [MAT Open Access CSV dataset](https://github.com/metmuseum/openaccess), downloaded on March 3rd, 2022.

    - Topics covered:
        - Packages: `tidyverse`, `dplyr`, `skimr` and `janitor`
        - Clean column names
        - Convert data types
